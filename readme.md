# 🍽️ Flavorly — Full-Stack MERN Restaurant Application

Flavorly is a modern, full-stack restaurant web application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
It allows users to explore dishes, make table reservations, send contact messages, and subscribe to a newsletter — all backed by a real database and REST API.

This project was built as a hands-on learning milestone to understand **end-to-end full-stack development**, from backend APIs to frontend UI and deployment.
